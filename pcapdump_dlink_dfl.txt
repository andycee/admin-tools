A Simple ExampleAn example of pcapdump usage is the following sequence:

> pcapdump -size 1024 -start int
> pcapdump -stop int
> pcapdump -show
> pcapdump -write int -filename=cap_int.cap
> pcapdump -cleanup

Going through this line by line we have:
1. Recording is started for the int interface using a buffer size of 1024 Kbytes.
> pcapdump -size 1024 -start int

2. The recording is stopped for the int interface.
> pcapdump -stop int

3. The dump output is displayed on the console in a summarized form.
> pcapdump -show

4. The same information is written in its complete form to a file called cap_int.cap.
> pcapdump -write int -filename=cap_int.cap

At this point, the file cap_int.cap should be downloaded to the management workstation foranalysis.

5. A final cleanup is performed and all memory taken is released.
> pcapdump -cleanup
